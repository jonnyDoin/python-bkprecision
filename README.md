# CISTEK / B&amp;K Precision Python Remote Control

This repository contains python example scripts for remote programming of B&K Precision instruments.

It is developed by GridVortex Systems for [CISTEK Equipamentos].

The repo has code examples for several instrument families, and general information and documentation for each family.


## Objectives 

The main purpose of this project is to provide simple examples to get users started with python and SCPI remote commands for test and measurement automation with B&K Precision instruments. 

Also shown are techniques to obtain realtime plotting of remote measurement from BK Instruments, to achieve better measurement automation results, and integration of multiple instruments in a simple python programming environment. 

The techniques exemplified in the scripts are not exclusive to BK instruments, and can be generally applied to many other instruments, but specific sequences and commands are specific to each family or model. All scripts here are tested in real B&K Precision instruments. 

<br>
Always read the manufacturers programming manual for the set of SCPI and proprietary commands supported by the instrument.
