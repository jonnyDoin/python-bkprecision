## Objectives 

The main purpose of the project is to provide simple examples to get users started with python and SCPI remote commands for test and measurement automation with B&K Precision instruments. 

The techniques exemplified in the scripts are not exclusive to BK instruments, and can be generally applied to many other instruments, but specific sequences and commands are specific to each family or model. 
<br>
Always read the manufacturers programming manual for the set of SCPI and proprietary commands supported by the instrument.
